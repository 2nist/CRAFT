# Admin Guide: Deployment & Updates

Use this guide when rolling out Craft Tools Hub to your team. It covers three supported deployment patterns:

1. **Local Installation (per workstation)**
2. **NAS-Hosted Shared Build (run from network share)**
3. **Portable Package (USB/portable directory)** ← optional but handy for contractors or quick demos

Each section includes installation, initial implementation tasks, day-to-day use, and update workflows.

---

## 1. Local Installation (Per Workstation)

### 1.1 Requirements
- Windows 10/11 workstation with write access to `%APPDATA%`
- Node/Electron not required after packaging (only needed on build machine)
- Antivirus exception for the install directory (prevents false positives on Electron apps)

### 1.2 Installation Steps
1. Build the app on an admin machine: `npm run electron:build` (outputs to `release/`).
2. Copy the resulting folder (e.g., `Craft Tools Hub-win32-x64`) to the target workstation under `%ProgramFiles%` or `C:\CraftToolsHub`.
3. Optionally create a desktop/start-menu shortcut pointing to `Craft Tools Hub.exe`.
4. Launch once to generate the user data directory at `%APPDATA%\electron-vite-react-app`.

### 1.3 Implementation (Initial Data Seeding)
- If you have curated data (component catalog, sub-assemblies, templates, manuals), copy your staged `%APPDATA%\electron-vite-react-app` folder onto the workstation before first launch.
- Otherwise, let the app use bundled defaults and run the maintenance steps to sync the latest CSVs.

### 1.4 Daily Use
- Users launch the local executable. Runtime data lives entirely under their profile (`%APPDATA%`).
- Backups are per user; include the `%APPDATA%` directory in workstation backup policies.

### 1.5 Updates
1. Build a new package (`npm run electron:build`).
2. Replace the install folder on each workstation (silent copy or use a packaging tool like PDQ Deploy).
3. User data remains untouched because it resides under `%APPDATA%`.
4. After major upgrades, rerun through the Weekly Checklist from the Maintenance guide to ensure synced data is current.

## 2. NAS-Hosted Shared Build (Run from Network Share)

### 2.1 Requirements
- Central NAS share accessible via UNC path (e.g., `\\NAS\CraftToolsHub`)
- Read/execute permissions for all users; write permission for admins to push updates.
- Network latency low enough for launching executables (<10–20 ms recommended).

### 2.2 Installation Steps
1. Build the app (`npm run electron:build`).
2. Copy the packaged folder to the NAS share, e.g., `\\NAS\CraftToolsHub\Craft Tools Hub-win32-x64`.
3. Distribute a shortcut to end users pointing to `\\NAS\CraftToolsHub\Craft Tools Hub-win32-x64\Craft Tools Hub.exe`.
4. Set the environment variable `CTH_RUNTIME_ROOT=\\NAS\CraftToolsHub\Craft Tools Hub-win32-x64` (or wherever you host the runtime) on each workstation. This redirects exports and manual syncs to the shared path. Provide `Set-CTHRuntimeRoot.ps1` from the NAS build if you want a one-click setup.
5. First launch still creates the user data folder under each user's `%APPDATA%`; only the binaries and shared outputs sit on the NAS.

### 2.3 Setting the Runtime Root Environment Variable

All users need the `CTH_RUNTIME_ROOT` environment variable set to the NAS path. This tells the app where to read/write shared data, logs, and exports.

**Option A: PowerShell Script (Recommended)**
```powershell
# Set-CTHRuntimeRoot.ps1 (automatically generated by publish-to-nas.ps1)
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('CTH_RUNTIME_ROOT', '\\NAS\CraftToolsHub\latest', 'Machine')
Write-Host "CTH_RUNTIME_ROOT set to \\NAS\CraftToolsHub\latest"
Write-Host "Please restart the Craft Tools Hub app for changes to take effect."
```

Run this script as Administrator on each user's machine, or distribute via Group Policy.

**Option B: Manual Setup via System Properties**
1. Open **System Properties** → **Environment Variables**
2. Under **System variables**, click **New**
3. Variable name: `CTH_RUNTIME_ROOT`
4. Variable value: `\\NAS\CraftToolsHub\latest` (or your NAS path)
5. Click **OK** and restart the app

**Option C: Registry Deployment (for IT admins)**
```powershell
# Deploy via Group Policy or login script
reg add "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment" /v CTH_RUNTIME_ROOT /t REG_SZ /d "\\NAS\CraftToolsHub\latest" /f
```

**Verification:**
- Launch the app and open **Settings → Runtime** tab
- Check that "Using Override" shows **Yes (NAS/Network)**
- Confirm "Current Runtime Root" points to your NAS path
- All `OUTPUT/LOGS` exports will now write to the NAS location

### 2.4 Implementation Notes
- The `publish-to-nas.ps1` script automatically generates `Set-CTHRuntimeRoot.ps1` and `Set-CTHRuntimeRoot.bat` helper scripts during deployment.
- These scripts set the `CTH_RUNTIME_ROOT` environment variable, which the app uses to determine runtime paths for exports and data.
- The script creates `build-info.json` with Git metadata (commit hash, branch, timestamp) for version tracking.
- To pre-seed data for everyone, place your curated `%APPDATA%\electron-vite-react-app` folder in a staging area. Provide a small script (PowerShell or batch) that copies it into the user profile on first run.
- If multiple admins maintain data, coordinate changes via source control or the maintenance checklist to keep components/sub-assemblies in sync before the weekly rebuild.
- The `latest` folder is automatically updated via Robocopy mirror, ensuring zero-downtime updates.

### 2.5 Daily Use
- Users launch the app via `run-app.bat` from the NAS `latest` folder or via desktop shortcut.
- The app runs locally but reads binaries from the NAS.
- User data remains local in `%APPDATA%`, so NAS downtime does not affect saved quotes or templates once the app is running.
- All OUTPUT logs and exports write to the shared NAS location (configured via `CTH_RUNTIME_ROOT`).
- **Verify Setup:** Open **Settings → Runtime** tab to confirm the app is using the NAS path.

### 2.6 Troubleshooting Runtime Configuration

**Problem:** OUTPUT files not appearing on NAS  
**Solution:** 
- Open **Settings → Runtime** and check "Using Override" status
- If it shows "No (Local)", the environment variable is not set or the app needs to be restarted
- Run verification command in PowerShell: `[System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('CTH_RUNTIME_ROOT', 'Machine')`
- Ensure the NAS path is accessible from the user's machine (test with `Test-Path \\NAS\CraftToolsHub\latest`)

**Problem:** "Network runtime root not accessible" error  
**Solution:**
- Check network connectivity to NAS
- Verify user has read/write permissions on the NAS share
- The app will automatically fall back to local runtime (`%APPDATA%\Craft Tools Hub\data`) if NAS is unreachable
- Fix network access, then restart the app to reconnect to NAS

**Problem:** Different users see different data  
**Solution:**
- Confirm all users have `CTH_RUNTIME_ROOT` pointing to the same NAS path
- Check **Settings → Runtime** on each machine to verify paths match
- Ensure NAS path uses consistent format (e.g., all use `\\NAS\CraftToolsHub\latest`, not mixed `\\10.0.0.5\...`)

### 2.6 Updates
1. **Build New Version**:
   ```powershell
   .\scripts\publish-to-nas.ps1 -Version "v1.1.0"
   ```
   This automatically:
   - Builds the latest code
   - Deploys to `updates/v1.1.0` folder
   - Updates the `latest` folder via mirror
   - Preserves previous versions for rollback

2. **Notify Users**: Send notification that new version is available. Users should exit and relaunch the app.

3. **Zero-Downtime Deployment**: The `latest` folder update is atomic (Robocopy mirror), so there's minimal disruption.

4. **Rollback if Needed**: Previous versions remain in `updates/v1.0rc`, etc. To rollback:
   ```powershell
   # Simply re-mirror the old version to latest
   robocopy "\\192.168.1.99\CraftAuto-Sales\Temp_Craft_Tools_Runtime\updates\v1.0rc" `
            "\\192.168.1.99\CraftAuto-Sales\Temp_Craft_Tools_Runtime\updates\latest" /MIR
   ```

5. **Data Updates**: If the component catalog or templates require bulk updates, push a refreshed `%APPDATA%` seed kit alongside the binary update and instruct users to replace their data folder before relaunching.

> **Tip:** The publish script automatically archives each version, so rollback is always available.

## 3. Portable Package (USB / Self-Contained Folder)

This option is useful for contractors, field demos, or situations where you cannot install software.

### 3.1 Requirements
- USB drive or removable SSD with at least 1 GB free.
- Windows host with ability to run executables from removable media.

### 3.2 Setup
1. Build the app (`npm run electron:build`).
2. Copy the packaged folder to the USB drive.
3. Create a sibling folder on the USB drive, e.g., `PortableData`, containing the desired `%APPDATA%\electron-vite-react-app` snapshot.
4. Create a helper script (`RunPortable.cmd`) that sets the `APPDATA` environment variable to point at the portable data folder before launching the app:
   ```cmd
   @echo off
   setlocal
   set APPDATA=%~dp0PortableData
   start "Craft Tools Hub" "%~dp0Craft Tools Hub-win32-x64\Craft Tools Hub.exe"
   ```
5. Users double-click the script; all runtime data stays on the USB drive.

### 3.3 Maintenance & Updates
- Replace the portable folder with a fresh build and updated `PortableData` snapshot when issuing updates.
- Remind users to close the app before unplugging the drive to avoid data corruption.

## 4. Implementation Advice (All Modes)

| Area | Recommendation |
|------|----------------|
| **Versioning** | Tag builds in Git and name release folders with the version/date (e.g., `CraftToolsHub_2025-11-07`). |
| **Data Seeding** | Use the maintenance scripts to produce a clean `%APPDATA%` snapshot after weekly checks. Distribute that snapshot with every build so fresh installations start from the same baseline. |
| **Security** | If manuals or catalogs contain sensitive pricing, set appropriate NTFS permissions on the NAS share or encrypted drives. |
| **Support** | Keep `ADMIN_GUIDE_FILE_LOCATIONS.md` and `ADMIN_GUIDE_MAINTENANCE.md` alongside this document for ready reference. |

---

## 5. Update Playbook

Regardless of deployment mode, follow this sequence for major updates:

1. **Prep**
   - Finish the maintenance checklist (component sync, template validation, manual link audit).
   - Commit changes to source control.
   - Run `npm run electron:build` and smoke-test the packaged app.

2. **Package**
   - Zip or copy the build folder to the distribution location (NAS, local installer share, or portable media).
   - Include a `README_RELEASE_NOTES.txt` summarizing changes.

3. **Distribute**
   - Local install: run the installer/copy script on each workstation.
   - NAS: replace the shared folder, notify users when ready.
   - Portable: update the USB package and hand it off.

4. **Post-Update Checks**
   - Launch the app, load a sample quote, generate a BOM, and open a manual to confirm all pipelines remain intact.
   - Update the maintenance log with the new build number and deployment date.
